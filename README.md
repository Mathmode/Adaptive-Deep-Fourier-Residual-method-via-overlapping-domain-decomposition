## Abstract


## Requirements

- Python 3.10.10
- TensorFlow 2.10
- NumPy

## Examples

We consider the following ODE in variational form: find $u\in H^1_0(0,\pi)$ satisfying the weak formulation of Poisson's equation, i.e., 

$\int_0^\pi u'(x)v'(x)-f(x)v(x)\,dx = 0 \qquad \forall v\in H^1_0(0,\pi),$

where $f$ is such that the exact solution is
$u^*(x)=x(x-\pi)\exp\left(-120\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2\right).$

The function $u^*$ is smooth but is mostly constant near the boundary and exhibits a prominent peak and a corresponding large derivative near $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
